# Python-Receipt-Generator
In this program, a user can enter random items they would like to purchase along with their price. 
The program will then identify if any of the entered items match a discount word from a dicitonary within the program that keeps record of certain words and their allocated discount percentages.
From there, the program will list the original price of each inputted item and will generate a subtotal that will subtract the discounted amount from any detected discount words.
After the subtotal has been generated, the program will then calculate the final total which will include the already generated subtotal plus the tax a user must pay.
Finally, the user will receive a file that recounts the items they purchased and their orginal price points along with the complete subtotal and final total amounts.
